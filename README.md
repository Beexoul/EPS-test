<h1>EPS Test </h1>
The EPS (Enter Per Second) test is a simple test to measure how fast one can hit the enter key on a keyboard. This test can be useful to evaluate typing speed and accuracy.

<h1>How to Run the Test</h1>
To run the test, simply run the Python code provided in a Python environment. The code prompts the user to hit the enter key as many times as possible within a 10-second interval. The program then calculates the number of enters per second (EPS) and displays the results.

<h1>Code Explanation</h1>
The code uses the time module to measure the elapsed time. It prompts the user to hit the enter key within a while loop that runs for 10 seconds. The loop counts the number of times the user hits the enter key and stores it in the count variable. The program then calculates the EPS score by dividing the count by 10. The results are displayed to the user.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The EPS test is a simple and quick way to evaluate typing speed and accuracy. By measuring how many times one can hit the enter key in 10 seconds, it provides a benchmark for evaluating typing speed.
